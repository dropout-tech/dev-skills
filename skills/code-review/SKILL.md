name: code-review
description: Multi-agent review of the local git diff. Spawns parallel agents covering bugs+security, CLAUDE.md adherence, git history, performance, plan adherence, and quality+architecture; tiers findings by confidence (Critical/Warning/Suggestion/Nit) and drops only auto-zeroed false positives; writes REVIEW.md. Also has a whole-tree mode (`/code-review tree [glob]`, or wording like 「審核架構／有沒有重複」) that audits the current source for duplication and missing abstractions instead of a diff. Use when the user says "review my changes", "review this branch", "code review", "審核架構", or invokes /code-review. Supersedes the built-in /code-review in repos using dev-skills — invoke only this one.

# Code Review

You are the orchestrator of a multi-agent code review. When delegation is available, fan out to specialized subagents, collect their findings, score them for confidence, and write a single `REVIEW.md` artifact. Otherwise perform the same review passes locally and disclose that no independent reviewers ran.

## Instruction-source compatibility

The legacy `claude-md` agent name, `claude_md_paths` field, and `{CLAUDE_MD_PATHS}` placeholder represent applicable project instructions from **both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`**. Pass this binding explicitly to every reviewer and scorer. References below to CLAUDE.md rules include those AGENTS.md rules; cite the actual source file verbatim. Label the report section "Project Instruction Adherence".

## Inputs

The user may pass a base ref (e.g. `main`, `HEAD~3`) or a plan file path. If neither, infer them in Phase 0 / Phase 1.

**Tree mode.** If the user passes `tree [glob]` or asks for a whole-codebase architecture / duplication audit (「審核現在的架構」「有沒有大量重複」), do NOT diff. Scope = the glob (default `src/**` minus generated files), working tree as-is. Skip Phase 1's diff intent; in Phase 2 spawn instead: one `quality-architecture` agent **per top-level area** (e.g. `app/(main)/products`, `app/(main)/admin`, `app/(main)/suppliers` + shared) plus **one cross-cutting duplication agent** over the whole scope (hunts pattern families with grep: action-runner boilerplate, page shells, table/select/label scaffolds, enum lists, repeated Tailwind strings), plus `claude-md`; `bugs-security` / `performance` optional, `git-history` / `plan-adherence` skipped. Tell every agent the ENTIRE file content is in scope and each duplication finding must cite ALL locations + a proposed abstraction (name, signature, home). In Phase 3 pass the rubric verbatim **plus an override note**: false-positive categories 1 and 8 do not apply in tree mode; concrete, location-cited duplication is the requested deliverable, not a "general code-quality complaint". Frontmatter `base`/`head` = current HEAD + "working tree"; add a `scope:` line.

Only one review orchestrator per session: this skill replaces the built-in `/code-review` — if built-in finder agents are already running, fold their reports into the finding pool instead of re-fanning out.

## Orchestrator Flow

### Phase 0 — Eligibility & Scope

1. Confirm git repo: `git rev-parse --git-dir`. If this fails, stop and tell the user the skill needs a git repository.
2. Determine `BASE`:
   - If user passed a base ref, use it.
   - Else: `git merge-base HEAD origin/main` (try `origin/master`, then local `main`/`master`).
   - Else: fall back to `HEAD~1` and warn the user that the diff base is approximate.
3. Compute changed files:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only $BASE..HEAD -- . \
     ':!.planning/' ':!ROADMAP.md' ':!STATE.md' \
     ':!*-SUMMARY.md' ':!*-VERIFICATION.md' ':!*-PLAN.md' \
     ':!package-lock.json' ':!yarn.lock' ':!pnpm-lock.yaml' \
     ':!Gemfile.lock' ':!poetry.lock' ':!*.min.js' ':!*.bundle.js' \
     ':!dist/' ':!build/'
   ```
4. If the resulting list is empty: write `REVIEW.md` with `status: skipped` (template below) and stop.

### Phase 1 — Context Gathering (one agent, sequential)

Spawn a single context agent (Claude: Haiku; Codex: inherited model) with this task:

> Given the file list `<FILES>` and repo root, return:
> 1. The paths to applicable `AGENTS.md` and compatibility `CLAUDE.md` files from the root through the changed-file directories. Deduplicate symlinks; prefer `AGENTS.md` in the same directory. **Paths only, do not read contents.**
> 2. The path to a plan/spec file if one exists. Look in: a path the user passed (`<PLAN_HINT>`), `.planning/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/specs/`, root `PLAN.md`. Return the first match or `null`.
> 3. A 1–2 sentence summary of the diff's apparent intent, based on `git diff --stat $BASE..HEAD` and the file paths. Do not read file contents.

Store the result as `CONTEXT = {claude_md_paths, plan_path, intent_summary}`.

### Phase 2 — Parallel Fan-Out (six review agents)

Claude: prefer Sonnet reviewers. Codex: inherit the parent model. Spawn reviewers up to the available concurrency limit, then continue in batches until all six aspects are covered. Each receives `BASE`, `HEAD`, the file list, and `CONTEXT`. Each returns `[{description, evidence, source_aspect}]` where `source_aspect` is one of `bugs-security`, `claude-md`, `git-history`, `performance`, `plan-adherence`, `quality-architecture`.

Agent prompts live in:
- `agents/bugs-security.md`
- `agents/claude-md.md`
- `agents/git-history.md`
- `agents/performance.md`
- `agents/plan-adherence.md`
- `agents/quality-architecture.md`

Read the prompt file, substitute `{BASE}`, `{HEAD}`, `{FILES}`, `{CLAUDE_MD_PATHS}`, `{PLAN_PATH}`, `{INTENT}`, and pass the result to the subagent.

**Agent modes:** Agents `bugs-security`, `quality-architecture`, and `performance` operate in **adversarial-recall mode** — surface every plausible candidate; the downstream confidence filter prunes false positives. Agents `claude-md`, `git-history`, and `plan-adherence` operate in **citation-only mode** — every finding must quote a verbatim source (CLAUDE.md rule, commit/PR reference, or plan section). Both modes feed the same Phase 3 scorer.

### Phase 3 — Confidence Scoring (one scorer per finding)

For each finding from Phase 2, spawn a scorer (Claude: Haiku; Codex: inherited model), using bounded parallel batches. Check its status before retrying a failed scorer; do not restart user-interrupted work without authorization. If delegation is unavailable, score locally and disclose the loss of independent scoring. The scorer receives:
- The finding (`description`, `evidence`, `source_aspect`)
- The diff (`git diff $BASE..HEAD` for the affected file)
- The CLAUDE.md path list

The scorer returns a single integer 0–100 per the **Confidence Rubric** below. For `claude-md` findings, the scorer must open the cited CLAUDE.md and verify it *literally* contains the rule the finding cites — if not, score 0. For `performance` findings, the scorer must verify `evidence.cost_model` has all four fields (`hot_path_class`, `frequency`, `per_call`, `verdict`) filled with concrete values — vague or missing values score 0; `hot_path_class: init/cold` with no startup-budget evidence scores 0; `verdict: negligible` should never appear (the agent should have dropped it) — if it does, score 0.
For any finding asserting a **DB schema fact** (a column / table / enum / RPC exists or not), verify against an **authoritative live source** — generated types (e.g. `database.types.ts`), the live DB via Supabase MCP, or migrations confirmed applied to remote — **NOT** local `docs/migrations/` or `docs/schemas/` files, which drift. If unconfirmable against such a source, cap at 25 (cannot be Critical).

### Phase 4 — Filter & Format

1. Drop only findings scoring exactly 0 (auto-zeroed false positives per the **False-Positive Categories** below). All other findings are kept.
2. If zero remain → write `REVIEW.md` with `status: clean` (template below) and stop.
3. Else → map confidence to severity (uniform across all `source_aspect`s, including `performance`; the performance agent's `verdict` is preserved as a displayed metadata field but does not override the tier):
   - 90–100 → Critical
   - 70–89 → Warning
   - 50–69 → Suggestion
   - 1–49 → Nit
4. Write `REVIEW.md` per the **Output Format** template, grouped first by `source_aspect`, then sorted within each group: Critical → Warning → Suggestion → Nit, then by confidence descending.

### Phase 5 — Summary to User

One line: `Found N findings (X critical, Y warning, Z suggestion, W nit). See REVIEW.md.` (or `Clean — no findings after dropping auto-zeroed false positives.` / `Skipped — no source files in diff scope.`).

Do not post anywhere external. No `gh pr comment`. Local-only.

## Confidence Rubric

For each issue, score 0–100:

- **0** — Not confident at all. False positive that doesn't stand up to light scrutiny, or a pre-existing issue.
- **25** — Somewhat confident. Might be a real issue, might be a false positive. The scorer wasn't able to verify. Stylistic issues not explicitly called out in CLAUDE.md belong here.
- **50** — Moderately confident. Verified as a real issue, but might be a nitpick or rare in practice. Not very important relative to the rest of the diff.
- **75** — Highly confident. Double-checked. Very likely real, will be hit in practice. The PR's existing approach is insufficient. Important and directly impacts functionality, or directly mentioned in the relevant CLAUDE.md.
- **100** — Absolutely certain. Double-checked and confirmed. Will happen frequently in practice. Evidence directly confirms it.

---

## False-Positive Categories

Treat these as automatic 0 scores:

1. **Pre-existing issues** — present before this diff.
2. **Bug-shaped non-bugs** — looks like a bug but isn't.
3. **Pedantic nitpicks** — a senior engineer wouldn't call this out.
4. **Linter / typechecker / compiler-catchable** — missing imports, type errors, broken tests, formatting, pedantic style. CI handles these.
5. **General code-quality complaints** — lack of test coverage, generic security concerns, poor documentation — *unless* CLAUDE.md explicitly requires it.
6. **Issues silenced by the author** — e.g., a lint-ignore comment on the line.
7. **Intentional behavior changes** related to the broader change.
8. **Real issues on unmodified lines** — only flag issues on lines the diff actually touches.

---

## Tone Constraints

When writing finding text:
- **Never** use "check", "confirm", "verify", or "ensure". Be declarative.
- Don't explain what the code does back to the author — they wrote it.
- One issue per finding entry. If duplicated across files, state it once and list the other locations as a single line.
- Reference only changed lines (those beginning with `+` or `-` in the diff), not surrounding context lines.

---

## Output Format

Write to `REVIEW.md` in the repo root.

## Applying Fixes

If the user asks to fix the findings after `REVIEW.md` is written: group findings by file, spawn one subagent per file in a single parallel tool-call block, each receiving all findings for its file. Serialize cross-file findings (e.g. signature changes that ripple to callers) into one agent.

---

## Critical Rules

- **Read-only.** Do not modify source files. The only file you may write is `REVIEW.md`.
- **Don't run typecheck / lint / tests.** CI handles those.
- **Cite `file:line` for every finding.** Never "somewhere in this file".
- **Skip findings on lines the diff doesn't touch.**
- **Phase 2:** use parallel agents within the host's available slots; use the disclosed local fallback if delegation is unavailable.
- **Phase 3:** batch independent scorers within the host's available slots.
- **Don't paraphrase the rubric or false-positive list when passing to scorer agents** — copy them verbatim.
