description: Detection-driven docs updater. Scans the project's doc layout, classifies the diff (schema / api / service / component / design / infra), proposes a per-file update plan, and edits only after user confirmation. Use when the user says "update the docs", "sync docs", "are the docs up to date?", "audit doc drift", or invokes /update-docs. Also invoked by /wrap-up step 3.

**Arguments:** `[scope: default=uncommitted | <commit> | <range> | --pr <num> | --all]`

# update-docs — detection-driven docs updater

Update the project's documentation to match a code change. The skill adapts to whatever doc layout the project actually uses; it does not assume a single convention.

## 1. Resolve scope

Parse the argument (or default):

- **No arg / default** — current uncommitted diff (`git diff` + `git diff --staged` + new untracked files).
- **A commit SHA or `HEAD`** — `git show <sha>`.
- **A range** like `HEAD~3..HEAD` — `git diff <range>`.
- **`--pr <num>`** — fetch with `gh pr diff <num>`.
- **`--all`** — audit-mode: walk the whole repo, looking for code/doc drift rather than per-diff updates.

**Fallback when the default scope is empty of your work.** Run right after a commit (e.g. straight after `/wrap-up`), the uncommitted diff holds only other people's leftovers — the work that needs documenting is already in `HEAD`. If the uncommitted diff is empty, or contains nothing this session wrote, scope to `HEAD` instead and say so in the proposal. A commit is also the moment docs go stale: check whether any doc describes the files you just committed as pending/untracked.

## 2. Detect doc layout

One fast scan; build a map of what doc files/folders exist:

- Top-level files: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `architecture.md`.
- Doc folders: `docs/`, `doc/`, `documentation/`.
- Inside each doc folder, look for:
  - `schemas/` (per-entity) vs `schema.md` (monolithic)
  - `api/` (per-resource) vs `api.md` (monolithic)
  - `components/` vs `components.md`
  - `design.md`, `services/`, `modules/`
  - `index.md` files (ERD overview, endpoint table, etc.)
- Per-repo splits: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `server/`, `client/`, `web/`, `mobile/`, `apps/*`, `packages/*`. For each subfolder that exists, repeat the doc scan inside it.

Classify each concern's convention as: **per-entity / monolithic / absent**.

## 3. Classify the diff

Read the scoped diff. Tag each change as one or more of:

- **schema** — DB models, ORM definitions, migration files, schema-shaped TypeScript types.
- **api** — route/handler/controller files, OpenAPI specs.
- **service / module** — service-layer or cross-cutting business logic.
- **component** — UI components, pages, layouts.
- **design-token** — CSS variables, theme files, Tailwind config, design system primitives.
- **infra** — Dockerfiles, CI configs, deploy scripts, folder-structure changes.

## 4. Propose

Print a single proposal showing both the detected layout and the file-by-file plan, then **wait for user confirmation**. Default to editing existing docs; propose a new doc file when the change warrants standalone treatment.

```
Detected docs layout:
  schemas/  → per-entity (4 files)
  api.md    → monolithic
  no frontend docs folder

Proposed updates:
  schemas/user.md   + field `verified_at` (timestamp, nullable)
  schemas/index.md  update User entity row
  api.md            + section "POST /verify"

Confirm? [y/n/edit]
```

- Showing the detected layout lets the user catch mis-detection (e.g., a legacy `schema.md` left over from an in-progress migration).
- For ambiguous diffs (multiple plausible targets), list all and let the user pick.
- When proposing a **new** doc file, consult [reference.md](./reference.md) for naming/placement defaults. Existing project structure always wins; the reference only seeds names when there's no precedent in the repo.

## 5. Edit on confirmation

After the user confirms, apply the changes:

- Keep entries terse:
  - **Schemas**: fields, constraints, lifecycle. Not prose.
  - **APIs**: method, path, auth, request shape, response shape.
  - **Components**: prop signature, slot/composition pattern, where it's used.
- Always update the matching `index.md` (ERD entry, endpoint table row, component list) alongside any per-entity / per-resource change.
- If unrelated drift is noticed in the same file, **flag it but don't fix it inline** — surface as a follow-up at the end.
- Per global rule: prefer `AGENTS.md` over `CLAUDE.md`; prefer the `docs/` folder over scattered top-level files.

### How to write the update: edit in place, annotate inline

For each fact that changed, **find the upstream section that already documents that concept** (Goal, Flow, Pages, Schema, etc.) and edit it directly so the section reflects current behavior. Add a small inline marker right next to the changed bullet / paragraph / table row:

```md
- /login dispatcher renders welcome OR quick-profile OR redirect _(2026-05-21: 從單純 welcome 改為 RSC dispatcher; 取代 /profile/complete)_
```

Or for larger structural changes, an inline HTML comment also works:

```md
<!-- 2026-05-21: court→capacity 3-button selector restored (was plain number input) -->
- WR-13: 1場 ≤ 8 / 2場 ≤ 17 / 3場 ≤ 26 ...
```

The marker says **when** + **what** in one line. The body around it stays the source-of-truth description of current behavior.

When adding a new heading or a new file, place it at the right spot in the existing section/folder order — not at the end.

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** appending a single trailing section titled `## YYYY-MM-DD updates` that mirrors upstream content. Two problems: (1) readers have to cross-reference top + bottom to know current state; (2) stale appended sections accumulate over time and bury the real source-of-truth. Edit upstream in place; the inline marker carries the date.

## Guardrails

- **Never edit before user confirmation.** No size exemption — a single-line or "obviously correct" doc fix still goes through Propose → Confirm. Don't inline-`Edit` a doc just because the change looks trivial; surface it in the proposal and wait.
- Never delete doc files; only add or modify.
- If `--all` audit mode finds drift but the diff is empty, still go through Propose → Confirm before editing.
- If multiple repos are detected (e.g., `backend-repo/` and `frontend-repo/` as siblings), make it clear in the proposal which repo each file lives in.
