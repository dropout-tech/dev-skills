# wrap-up — Full mode

Run steps in order. Stop and surface failures rather than pushing through.

**Always prompt with `AskUserQuestion` (popup) for decision points** — open-a-PR, push confirmation, manual-deploy check, deploy-command confirmation, and "fix or defer" choices in code review. Inline text questions are too easy to miss. Provide 2–4 concrete options per question; the user can still pick "Other" to type a custom response.

## 0. Scope check (large diffs only)

Run `git diff --stat <this session's commits> | tail -1` — find them by message / `Session:` footer (`git log --grep`), not `HEAD~1..HEAD`: in a multi-session repo HEAD is often someone else's commit. If **>25 files or >2000 lines**, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` which steps to defer — common skips: `/code-review`, `/update-docs`, or E2E in `/verify`. Capture deferred scope in the report's `# Unsolved Issues` or the plan's Verification section. Skip this step for small diffs — **unless this session already committed or already ran the tests**: then ask (multiSelect) which steps to skip, e.g. `/verify`, `/code-review`, deploy.

## 1. Verify correctness

- Invoke `/verify` (the `verify` skill) to execute the implementation plan's Test plan section. It handles plan lookup, skip-if-already-run, command resolution, and per-item pass/fail reporting.
- Wait for `/verify` to finish. If any check fails, **stop here** — do not continue to later steps until the user resolves it.

## 2. Update docs

- Invoke `/update-docs` (the `update-docs` skill) scoped to the current diff. That skill detects the project's doc layout, proposes a per-file update plan, and waits for confirmation before editing.
- **Run the skill — don't substitute hand-picked manual doc edits.** Even when you think you know which 2–3 docs changed, the detection pass catches stale references in docs you wouldn't open (glossary, architecture, feature-index status rows, sibling feature docs). Editing a few by hand and skipping detection leaves drift the user will catch later ("why didn't update-docs get this?").
- Wait for `/update-docs` to finish before continuing.

## 3. Code review

- Invoke `/code-review` (the `code-review` skill) to run a multi-agent review of the diff (including the doc updates from step 2). It writes findings to `REVIEW.md` filtered through a confidence threshold.
- **If you substitute a scoped reviewer for `/code-review`** (e.g. a multi-session dirty tree where the full skill would sweep dozens of other-session files, so you point a single reviewer agent at just this session's diff), you MUST still **persist its findings to `REVIEW.md`** yourself (with the `status: issues_found | clean` frontmatter). Steps 3–4 depend on the file existing — it's read here and folded into the report + deleted in step 4. An inline-only review that skips the file leaves the user without the expected artifact.
- **Before writing `REVIEW.md`, check whether one already exists from a DIFFERENT session** (frontmatter `scope` / `session` / `date` describes work that isn't yours — common in a multi-session repo). If so, **do NOT overwrite or delete it** — write your findings to a distinct filename (e.g. `REVIEW-<slug>.md`) and read / fold / delete THAT file in steps 3–4–6 instead. Clobbering another session's review destroys their unaddressed findings.
- Read `REVIEW.md`. If it has `status: issues_found`, surface the findings, then use `AskUserQuestion` to ask how to proceed. Suggested options: "Fix all", "Fix selected (I'll list them)", "Defer all to report". For per-item triage on a small number of findings, you may ask one `AskUserQuestion` per finding with options like "Fix now" / "Defer".
- Items the user fixes: fix them, then re-run `/code-review` to confirm. Items the user defers: note them so step 4 (report) carries them into the report's `# Unsolved Issues` section. Items the user fixed during this step go into the report's `# Updates` section.
- Wait for `/code-review` and any user fixes to finish before continuing.

## 4. Generate report

- Invoke `/report` (the `report` skill) to capture what was done — conversation, file changes, actions — into `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-[title].md`.
- Carry `/verify` evidence into the report: name the checks and manual scenarios, include representative inputs and observed results, and record anything intentionally not exercised. A bare “tests passed” is insufficient for non-trivial feature work.
- Skip if the change is trivial (typo, single-line fix) or the user opts out.
- After `/report` completes successfully, delete `REVIEW.md` — its findings are now folded into the report's `# Updates` and `# Unsolved Issues` sections, and leaving it behind causes stale-state confusion on the next wrap-up. If `/report` was skipped, leave `REVIEW.md` in place — step 6 will offer to clean it up.

## 5. Session hygiene

- After saving the report (and any plan integration), invoke the `rename-session` skill with the report's `YYYY-MM-DD-[title]` as the argument so the session name matches the report. It routes Codex through app-server and Claude Code through its JSONL helper. For multiple reports, use the first report's title.

## 6. Clean up temp files

Sweep session-created files before commit. Scan untracked files (`git status --short` `??` entries) + known temp paths; skip in non-git repos. Classify each candidate, then ask three `AskUserQuestion` prompts (all `multiSelect: true`) **in order: Move → Gitignore → Delete**. Skip step if all buckets empty.

**Move** → relocate, don't delete:
- Agent scratchpads (`findings.md`, `*-analysis.md`, `*-notes.md`) → `docs/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>-artifacts/`
- `PLAN.md` at root → `docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`

**Gitignore** → keep local, block commit:
- Experimental variants: `*-v2.*`, `*-experimental.*`, `*.old.*`, `*-approach-*.*`, `*-draft.*`
- Append to `.gitignore` and auto-stage it. Print: `Reminder: gitignored variants stay on disk — move to a branch if you need them; they must not land on main.`

**Delete:**
- Unreferenced one-off scripts at root (`.py`/`.ts`/`.sh`)
- Debug output (`*.log`, `output.log`, `stderr.txt`, `test-output.*`)
- Editor cruft (`*.swp`, `*~`, `.#*`, `.DS_Store`)
- Untracked temp dirs (`tmp/`, `scratch/`, `playground/`)
- Root screenshots/recordings (`screenshot-*.*`, `recording-*.*`)
- `REVIEW.md` if `/report` was skipped

**Never surface:** anything git-tracked; `docs/**` documentation (move, don't delete); `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`README.md`/configs/lockfiles; gitignored caches (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`); `.env*`.

**Guardrails:** never delete a doc file (route to Move if in doubt); never delete anything not surfaced via these buckets; `rm -rf` only for the temp dirs listed above.

## 7. Commit (PR optional)

**Read `./commit.md` now (`cat` it) — do not commit from memory of it.** It holds the pre-commit safety checks, smart staging rules, the mandatory `Session: <name> (<id>)` footer, and the push fallback; a wrap-up that skipped this read shipped 5 commits without the footer. Then Full mode adds:

- **If a report was generated in step 4**, before staging, use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Include report?") with question _"Include the report file in this commit?"_ and options:
  - `Defer to /sync-report` (default — keeps the code commit focused; `/sync-report` owns the report commit and can resolve Github Link from HEAD reliably).
  - `Include now` — stage the report alongside the code.
- Write the commit message focused on **why**, not what. Follow the repo's existing commit style (check `git log` for tone). If the preferred commit styles are mentioned in the docs, such as `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, or `docs/*.md`, follow those.
- Commit.
- **Push popup** (header: "Push?") with three options: **Open PR** (`git push` + `gh pr create`), **Push direct** (`git push` to tracked branch), **Stop** (commit stays local).
- ASK FIRST via `AskUserQuestion` before any push, force-push, or destructive git operation — never inline-ask for these.

## 8. Sync report to Notion

Independent of the commit/push in step 7 — its **own** step so it isn't swallowed next to the push popup. **Skip the whole step** only when `AGENTS.md` (preferred) / `CLAUDE.md` has no `## Notion` section, or step 4 produced no report. Otherwise it runs every time.

When it runs: **auto-invoke `/sync-report`** on the report from step 4. `/sync-report` resolves the Github Link from the wrap-up commit (builds the sha URL from `git remote` even when **unpushed**), appends the report body to the Notion task, suggests Status, writes `last_synced` back to the report frontmatter, and owns its own report-commit prompt.

- **The push decision (step 7) does NOT gate this.** Notion sync and `git push` are independent — a `Stop` / hold-push choice only defers the git push and is never a reason to skip the sync. Only skip if the user explicitly says so.
- If HEAD advanced under you (another session committed on top mid-wrap-up), point the Github Link at THIS session's wrap-up commit (match by message / slug), not bare HEAD.

## 9. Deploy

Three branches, evaluated in order. The first match wins; each branch ends the step.

Remember:

- Never run a deploy command without explicit user confirmation in the same turn.
- Never re-deploy if Branch B detected an earlier deploy in this session — confirm only.
- Skip cleanly when CI/CD is detected — don't manufacture a manual deploy.
- **Schema ships before code.** If the repo has a migrations dir, diff it against the target DB's applied-migrations table *before* deploying and apply what's pending. A stale schema fails at runtime, not at deploy time — the deploy "succeeds" and pages 500 days later.

### Branch A — CI/CD handles deploy → skip

If any of these signals are present, print `CI/CD handles deploy on merge — skipping.` and end:

- `.github/workflows/*.yml` contains a deploy job (uses `vercel-action`, `superfly/flyctl-actions`, `cloudflare/wrangler-action`, `aws-actions/*`, `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`, etc., or a job named `deploy` / `release` / `publish` triggered on push to main).
- `vercel.json` or `.vercel/` exists (assume Vercel Git integration unless docs say otherwise).
- `fly.toml` plus a `.github/workflows/fly*.yml`.
- `netlify.toml` (Netlify Git integration).
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `README.md` says "deploys automatically on merge", "CI deploys", "auto-deploy".

### Branch B — Already deployed in this conversation → confirm

If Branch A didn't match, scan this session's transcript for prior deploy signals:

- Bash commands like `vercel`, `vercel deploy`, `fly deploy`, `flyctl deploy`, `wrangler deploy`, `wrangler publish`, `gh workflow run`, `git push heroku`, `git push dokku`, `firebase deploy`, `netlify deploy`, `eb deploy`, `kubectl apply`, `helm upgrade`, `terraform apply`.
- Tool outputs containing deploy URLs (`*.vercel.app`, `*.fly.dev`, `*.workers.dev`, `*.netlify.app`, `*.web.app`, custom domains from docs).
- User messages saying "I deployed", "deployed to <url>", "shipped it".

If found, print `Looks like deploy already happened in this session: <evidence>. Done.` and end. Do not re-deploy.

### Branch C — Ask the user, then offer to deploy

Use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Deployed?") with question _"Have you deployed this change manually (outside this session)?"_ and options "Yes, already deployed" / "No, need to deploy".

- **Yes** → end.
- **No** → run deploy-docs detection and offer to deploy:

  1. Look for deploy instructions in `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `README.md` (sections titled "Deployment", "Deploy", "Release", "Shipping"), `docs/deploy*`, `docs/deployment*`, `docs/release*`, `docs/runbook*`. Also note provider configs: `Dockerfile`, `Procfile`, `fly.toml`, `vercel.json`, `wrangler.toml`, `netlify.toml`, `app.yaml`, `serverless.yml`, `package.json`.
  2. Show the user the doc excerpt, the exact command(s) to run, and any preconditions the docs mention (env vars, login state, branch).
  3. **Use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Run deploy?") to confirm execution** — options "Yes, run it" / "No, stop". Never run a deploy command without an explicit popup confirmation in the same turn.
  4. On confirm, execute. On failure, surface output and stop — do not retry or fall back to a different command.
  5. After a successful deploy, **fetch a real page before calling it deployed** — an authenticated GET that actually renders, not just the root URL. `200` alone proves nothing: RSC prefetches (`?_rsc=`), `HEAD`, and unauthenticated `307`s to a login page all return success without running the page's queries. Pair it with the platform's error log. Until that fetch is green, say "deployed, not yet verified".

- If no deploy docs are found in the "no" branch: tell the user `No deploy docs found. Add deploy instructions to AGENTS.md or docs/deploy.md and re-run wrap-up.` and end.
- Never invent deploy commands. If docs are silent, stop and tell the user — don't guess `yarn deploy`, `npm run deploy`, `make deploy`, etc.

## 10. Self-improve

- Always invoke `/improve` (the `improve` skill) to surface refinement suggestions from session friction — skill instructions, workflow sequencing, user-instructions analysis, and `REVIEW.md` findings.
- If suggestions are surfaced, `/improve` owns its own scope prompts (Global / Org / Local) and applies edits inline.
- `/improve` also **commits the skill repo it edited** (its own Wrap up step). Step 7 ran before this, so don't expect it to have covered those files — and don't re-commit them here.

## Guardrails

- Match the global "executing actions with care" rules.
- If `/verify` reports any failure, stop the wrap-up flow.
- Never push or open a PR without explicit user confirmation **via `AskUserQuestion`** — inline text questions are too easy to miss in a long wrap-up flow.
